 * Note that we also have Engine_kind.t, which is an alias to
 * semgrep_output_v1.engine_type with just `OSS | `Pro, and even
 * Semgrep_metrics_t.engine_config. However, the goal of this module is to
 * encode the CLI flags, to configure the engine, whereas Engine_kind.t is more
 * useful to tag findings and Semgrep_metrics_t.engine_config as the name
 * suggests are metrics for us.
