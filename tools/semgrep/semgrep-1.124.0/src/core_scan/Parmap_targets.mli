(* Run jobs in parallel, using number of cores specified with -j.
 *
 * Note that the jobs are currently run in forked process, so while
 * the job will inherit the memory from the parent process, any modification
 * in the child process of the memory (e.g., modifying a global hash table)
 * will not be seen by the parent! So the job function should be a pure
 * function!
 * See: Parmap_.mli for why this returns a result list!
